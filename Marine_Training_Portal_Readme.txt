Marine Training Portal â€“ Continuation Handoff Document

Project Overview
----------------
The Marine Training Portal is a Flask-based web application that serves as a structured training platform for Marines. It allows Trainers and Admins to enroll users in modular cyber training courses and track individual and unit progress.

Current Functionality
---------------------
Roles
- All users start as basic students by default.
- Admins or Training Managers can assign additional roles:
  - Admin â€” full access to manage users, roles, courses, and the backend.
  - Trainer â€” can enroll users in courses and track progress.
  - Marine â€” standard user who completes assigned tasks.

Authentication & Access
- Uses Flask-Login for user sessions.
- Flask-WTF for form handling.
- All roles are checked before rendering pages or submitting data.

Course & Task Structure
- Courses are made from hierarchically organized tasks, pulled from USMC JQR documents.
- Tasks are structured as:
  - Modules (e.g., 1.0)
  - Sections (e.g., 1.1)
  - Tasks (e.g., 1.1.1) â€” only these are interactable.

Courses Implemented
- Host Basic
- Network Basic
- Host Senior
- Network Senior

Course Pages
- Rendered with:
  - Bold section headers
  - Clickable tasks
  - âœ…/ðŸ”² based on completion
- Each course displays percentage progress and auto-updates when tasks are completed.

Admin Panel
- Create, edit, and delete:
  - Courses
  - Modules (headers)
  - Sections (sub-headers)
  - Tasks
- Tasks can be:
  - Auto-Graded (with answer)
  - Trainer-Graded (with submission + feedback)
  - API-Graded (e.g., TryHackMe integration coming soon)

Trainer Panel
- Can:
  - Enroll Marines into courses
  - View active enrollments and progress
  - Disenroll users
- UI displays real-time course status.

Marine Dashboard
- Displays:
  - Assigned courses
  - Progress per course
  - Completed courses

User Profiles
- Profile includes:
  - Name, email, and role(s)
  - Completed courses
  - Uploadable profile picture
  - Placeholder for ranks, accolades, and leaderboard integration

In-Progress / Recently Completed
--------------------------------
- Hierarchical task structure built into courses
- Course and Task page refactor
- Tasks now organized under headers, with clean display
- Functional training panel and dashboards for each role
- Forms to create Modules, Sections, and Tasks added to edit_course.html
- Profiles created
- Admin course builder interface online

Tips for Continuation
---------------------
- All forms use Flask-WTF. If a form error occurs, update both forms.py and the route.
- User roles are stored as booleans: is_admin, is_trainer.
- Task hierarchy uses label (e.g., 1.1.1) and is_section_header.
- Course progress is recalculated each time a task is marked complete.
